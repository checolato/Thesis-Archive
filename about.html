        Reconstructing Place Familiarity in Taoyuan with a Human-Centric Digital Twin for Sensory Architecture
      </h2>

      <h3 class="about-section-label">Research Question</h3>
      <p class="about-section-text">
        How can memory become a form of orientation when the tectonic city is no longer legible?
      </p>

      <h3 class="about-section-label">Abstract</h3>
      <p class="about-section-text">
        This thesis begins with a feeling familiar to many who grew up in rapidly developing cities: the disorientation of
        returning home and realizing that the places that shaped us have vanished. As skylines rise and districts are
        rebuilt, the environmental cues that once grounded our memories dissolve, creating a widening gap between the
        physical city and the one we carry inside us. This gap raises a deeper question: what happens to memory when the
        landscape that held it disappears?
      </p>

      <p class="about-section-text">
        Taoyuan, Taiwan, a city defined by industrial parks, logistics hubs, and its proximity to Taipei, has undergone
        one of the fastest transformations in the country. With the launch of the Taoyuan Aerotropolis plan, thousands
        of hectares were rezoned for airport-centered development. Entire neighborhoods were cleared; farmland and
        family homes were absorbed into an emerging financial district. In every sweep of excavation, soil covered not
        only agricultural land but also the stories, rhythms, and futures of the people who lived there.
      </p>

      <p class="about-section-text">
        Amid these shifts, this project turns to one of Taoyuan’s most characteristic landscapes: the 埤塘 (pond). More
        than remnants of an agricultural past, these ponds act as sensory anchors—sites of humidity, reflection, sound,
        and ecological life that once imprinted themselves onto daily experience. They serve as emotional and mnemonic
        cues that endure even when the built environment does not.
      </p>

      <p class="about-section-text">
        This thesis proposes a Human-Centered Digital Twin (H-DT) that translates pond-based sensory logics into
        interactive systems for present-day residents. Instead of treating the pond as a vanished landscape, the twin
        treats its hydrological behaviors—humidity gradients, reflective light, and ecological sound—as active mediators
        of human presence and spatial perception. These sensory cues become data-driven conditions that influence how
        human agents learn, navigate, and annotate urban space.
      </p>

      <p class="about-section-text">
        By engaging with the digital twin, residents can participate in reconstructing the affective and ecological
        qualities that once grounded Taoyuan, even if the original ponds no longer exist. Through this approach, the
        digital twin becomes a platform for co-creating new forms of familiarity within a city that continues to shift
        beneath its inhabitants.
