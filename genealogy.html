          <li class="water-spatial">
            <a href="#"><span class="blend-text">Hakka Water-Village Settlement Patterns<br>Hakka communities in southern China and Taiwan often arranged homes, farmlands, and social spaces around ponds and water courts. Spatial identity emerged from water edges, circulation paths, and agricultural tasks. This reinforces water’s role as the primary organizer of human presence.</span></a>
          </li>
          <li class="water-spatial">
            <a href="#"><span class="blend-text">Vietnamese Mekong Wetland Settlements<br>Communities organize homes, markets, and routes around shifting water levels. The spatial logic of stilt houses, floating markets, and seasonal pathways parallels the interest in water-driven movement and environmental familiarity.</span></a>

          <li class="water-temporal">
            <a href="#"><span class="blend-text">Living Hydrological Systems<br>Mountain-scale hydrological design integrating water flows with community rhythms, planting cycles, and ecological care. A spatial precedent for “water as timekeeper” and “topography as memory,” relevant to how digital twins tie ponds to human cycles.</span></a>
